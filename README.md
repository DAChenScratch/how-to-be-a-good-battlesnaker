# How to be a good battlesnaker (with DAChenScratch) (not assuming he is the best battlesnaker)
<h3>Developing your battlesnake</h3>
<br>
So, first thing is that any sort of AI is fine! You can have a snake that moves random good moves, an A* based one, maybe a tree search or even a ML one. But the most important thing is that you should never give up trying to make your battlesnake. Many great AIs were ruined early since their user gived up and thought it was too hard. That's like, exactly the reason why we have a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BYubeHQ">discord community</a> and a <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T0E9FQAAE/CUK6WHK16">Slack community</a>. But the most important part is: if you're having a hard time, break the hard tasks into little, easier steps. We can't wait to see your new battlesnake!
